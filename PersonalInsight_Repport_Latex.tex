\mtcaddchapter[Introduction générale]
The purpose of this study is to know more about the customer‘s tendency of
purchasing goods and finding the different patterns among the customer groups as well as to
check the loyalty of the customers with the company so the company will be able to make
different marketing strategies to build up their loyal and profitable customer base, since, in
the era of globalization and digitalization, customers have got different platforms to purchase
anything, so it has become difficult to secure Customer base. As attracting customers is the
main focus of every business the findings and suggestions of this research will help the
company to construct various research factors to decide their marketing strategies. In this
study, various unsupervised learning algorithms used to analyze customer data. In
Unsupervised machine learning algorithms clusters are formed. In this paper, we have used
the PCA technique for dimensionality reduction and Agglomerative Clustering, Affinity Clustering, BIRCH,DBSCAN ,Mini-Batch K-Means, Mean Shift, OPTICS, Spectral Clustering, Gaussian Mixture
techniques to know the customer‘s segment, the company has to focus and set their hundred
per cent effort to give better service to their customer base.\\

\chapter{Introduction and Background}

\minitoc
\textbf{Customer personality analysis}  is the process of identifying and understanding the unique
characteristics and traits that make up an individual customer's personality. This information can
be used by companies to tailor their marketing and sales efforts to better target and serve each
customer's specific needs and preferences.\\

Traditionally, customer personality analysis has been done manually by marketing and sales teams,
who would use their expertise and experience to identify common patterns and trends among
customers. However, with the advent of data mining and machine learning, it is now possible to
automate this process using algorithms that can analyze large amounts of data and identify
common patterns and traits among customers. \\

One type of machine learning algorithm that can be used for customer personality analysis is
unsupervised learning. Unsupervised learning algorithms are trained on a large amount of data and
can automatically detect patterns and similarities among customers without being explicitly told
what to look for. This makes them particularly well suited for customer personality analysis, as
they can uncover subtle differences and trends that might not be immediately apparent to humans.\\
The dataset for this project is a public dataset from Kaggle provided by Dr. Omar RomeroHernandez. This dataset has 2,240 rows of observations and 28 columns of variables. Among the
variables, there are 5-character variables and 23 numerical variables.\\

In this paper, we will discuss the use of unsupervised learning algorithms for customer personality
analysis, and how they can be used by companies to better understand and serve their customers.
We will also provide an overview of the different types of unsupervised learning algorithms and
how they work, as well as discuss some of the challenges and limitations of using unsupervised
learning for customer personality analysis.\\

\section{People}
\subsection{What is the distribution of the years of birth for our customers?}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=24cm, height=15cm]{Capture d’écran 2024-01-10 à 12.56.12.png}

\subsection{What is the education level distribution?}

\begin{center}

    \includegraphics[width=19cm, height=15cm]{Capture d’écran 2024-01-10 à 12.59.55.png}

\newpage
\subsection{What is the martial status of the majority of customers?}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[]{Capture d’écran 2024-01-10 à 13.01.51.png}            
    \label{fig1}
\end{center}
 \textbf{We can see a multitude of invalid values. ['Married', 'Together'] can count as a relationship. While ['Single', 'Divorced', 'Widow', 'Alone'] all fall under single status. Meanwhile 'Absurd' and 'YOLO' can be discarded since they do not have any meaning}
 \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=27cm, height=13cm]{Capture d’écran 2024-01-10 à 13.08.00.png}            
    \label{fig1}
   
\end{center}
 

\subsection{What is the income of most of the cutomers?}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=25cm, height=13cm]{Capture d’écran 2024-01-10 à 13.11.37.png}            
    \label{fig1}
\end{center}

\subsection{What is the most common number for kids and teens?}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=25cm, height=13cm]{Capture d’écran 2024-01-10 à 13.13.52.png}            
    \label{fig1}
\end{center}
\subsection{Since when did the supermarket gain its customers?}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=24cm, height=13cm]{Capture d’écran 2024-01-10 à 17.48.34.png}            
    \label{fig1}
\end{center}

\subsection{What is the percentage of complaining customers?}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=18cm, height=7cm]{Capture d’écran 2024-01-10 à 17.51.12.png}            
    \label{fig1}
\end{center}
\newpage
\section{Products}
\subsection {Which products do people spend the most amount on?}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=18cm, height=7cm]{Capture d’écran 2024-01-10 à 17.52.38.png}      
\end{center}     
50\% of the average customer spending is on wine, followed by meat at 27\% of spendings.


\subsection {Does the product spending differ by education level?}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=22cm, height=12cm]{Capture d’écran 2024-01-10 à 17.59.22.png}      
\end{center}     
The figure indicates that PhD holders spend the most on wine. For fruits, gold, and meat products, "graduation" educated individuals spend the most. While "2n cycle" spend the most on fish and sweets.

\subsection {Does Dissatisfaction Affect Spending?}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=22cm, height=16cm]{Capture d’écran 2024-01-10 à 18.02.00.png} 
    \includegraphics[width=5cm, height=5cm]{Capture d’écran 2024-01-10 à 18.03.36.png}
\end{center}     
As expected, people who complain about the service use it less. The average spending for complainers is far less across all product categories.
\newpage
\section{Promotion}
\subsection {What is the distributed of discounted purchases among different education levels?}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=18cm, height=15cm]{Capture d’écran 2024-01-10 à 18.05.55.png} 
    
\end{center}     
We can see that the least educated individuals have a significantly higher percentage of discounted purchases. The least percentage of discounted purchases is carried out by PhD holders.

\subsection {Which campaign is the most successfull among customers?}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=18cm, height=15cm]{Capture d’écran 2024-01-10 à 18.08.01.png} 
    
\end{center}     
We can observe that the demand on campaign offers is extremely low among customers, as the most successful campaign attracted only about 15\% of the customers.
\subsection{Calculating age by year of birth since age is useful in classification}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=18cm, height=6cm]{Capture d’écran 2024-01-10 à 18.11.55.png}
    \includegraphics[width=22cm, height=6cm]{Capture d’écran 2024-01-10 à 18.13.59.png}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=19cm, height=7cm]{Capture d’écran 2024-01-10 à 18.16.16.png}
\end{center} 
\textbf{Insights:}
\vskip 0.2cm
We can see it's a normal distribution of customer's age\\
Most of the customers are from 34 to 50.

\chapter{Data Preprocessing}
\textbf{Data preprocessing} refers to converting the raw data into meaningful data by
manipulating the data. Data can contain missing values, outliers and inconsistent data. Data
preprocessing most important step in data analysis because data which is not properly or
carefully preprocessed can give misleading results. Data cleaning refers to identifying
missing values, incorrect, corrupted, duplicate, incorrectly formatted or incomplete data
within the dataset and fixing or removing them. Data cleaning can be done interactively with
help of data-wrangling tools\\

\vspace{0,1cm}
\textbf{Steps taken to Preprocessing Dataset:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The income column of the data frame has 24 missing values. The missing numbers are
being dropped because it is fewer. 
\vspace{0,5cm}
\item We are creating a feature that displays the length of time a customer has been in the
company's database. This feature will be based on the "Dt Customer" data.
\vspace{0,5cm}
\item We replaced the unique values in ‗Marital\_Status‘ and ‗Education‘ for the sake of
simplicity of the analysis of the data.
\vspace{0,5cm}
\item To Obtain the age of the customer we added the new column ‗Current\_year‘ so that
we could add a new column ‗Age‘, by the using ‗Birth\_year‘ and ‗Current\_year‘
columns. We plotted the boxplot for the age, but there were outliers, to remove
outliers we used the cap method to remove the outliers.
\vspace{0,5cm}
\item Add a new feature called "Spent" that displays the customer's overall spending across all
categories over a two-year period.
\vspace{0,5cm}
\item We added the ‗Is\_parent‘ column by using ‗Teenhome‘ and ‗Kidhome‘ for more
understanding of the data
\vspace{0,5cm}
\item After plotting for “Income” and “Age”, outliers are present which will be deleted
\vspace{0,5cm}
\item Dropping the columns of deals accepted and promotions, then scaling the remaining
features using “Standard scaler”.

\chapter{Dimensionality reduction using PCA}
\textbf{Principal component analysis (PCA)} is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of such
datasets, increasing interpretability but at the same time minimizing information loss.
The final classification in this challenge will be based on a wide range of variables. These aspects
or characteristics are essentially these factors. Working with it becomes more challenging the more
features it has. The correlation between several of these features makes them unnecessary. For this
reason, before running the features through a classifier, I shall reduce their dimensionality.
We are reducing the dimensions to 3. After this we will be plotting these data frame.

\section{Affinity Clustering Model}
Affinity Propagation involves finding a set of exemplars that best summarize the data. It is implemented via the AffinityPropagation class and the main configuration to tune is the “damping” set between 0.5 and 1, and perhaps “preference.”\\

\section{BIRCH Clustering }
\textbf{BIRCH Clustering} (BIRCH is short for Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies) involves constructing a tree structure from which cluster centroids are extracted. It is implemented via the Birch class and the main configuration to tune is the “threshold” and “n\_clusters” hyperparameters, the latter of which provides an estimate of the number of clusters.\\

\chapter{Comparing the models }

\textbf{Ther Davies Bouldin Index (DBI) measures the ratio between the distances of cluster points to the center and the distance between cluster centers. Therefore, we want a small number. The Silhouette Index, measures the distances between points of the same clusters, and distances between the same points and other cluster's points. This way, it can get a measure of cluster fit, how good does the point fit in its cluster.}

we can clearly see that Affinity clustering has the best score of evaluation , However , it gave us an absurd amount of clusters, so we can say it got the best evaluation because all finlly similiar points are of the same cluster , so the theorical aspect of this approach does not help in the goals of this study , which is helping the marketing campaign , therefore *Agglomerative * works best for our objective.\\

Note : the evaluation of clustering models is just a theorical aspect as we said earlier , diffrent supermarkets for example or any organisation have diffrent goals for their stratigies, for example ,\\

if they want to make the campaign mainly for the high income and high spending customers , the agglomerative model comes out with the best result for that,\\

if they want to regulate the campaign and need to atract all sorts of customers , then they will need the number of customers per cluster (id. groupe) to be close on similiar equal distribution , the Mini-Batch K-means model have the best result for that,\\

and so on , in our future analysis on customers , also said Customer Profiling , we'll study only the outcome of the Agglomerative Clustering Model , and deploy it , and try to make new predictions at the end.\\

Concept : We'll try to deploy all the models and guide the companies towards using the best model that suits there objective.\\
